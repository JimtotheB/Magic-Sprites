#This is a YAML file, use spaces NEVER TABS, or it will fail miserably.

  #set this to the absolute path of your project if you want MagicIcons to work
  #with files outside its own directory. (which I strongly suggest)
  projectRoot: "./"

  #Path to your image folder, relative to projectRoot.
  iconImagePath: "images/icons_white/48px/"

  #Path and filename to output your image data, classnames, etc.
  #this file will be auto-generated.
  iconDataPath: "data/simple-icons.json"

  #This will remove everything after the character provided.
  #Ie: the simple-icon files that come bundled all end with -16, -32, -64
  #If your images do not need to be trimmed, or you dont want them trimmed,
  #set this to "iconSplitOnChar: false" without quotes.
  iconSplitOnChar: "-"

  #This is ONLY if you arent generating a base64 image for your sprite sheet, as is default.
  #I highly suggest leaving this alone.

  cssOutputDirectory: "assets/css/"

  #CSS filename that will ultimately be written to ./assets/css
